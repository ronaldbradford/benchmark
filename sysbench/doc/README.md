# Understanding `sysbench`

[Sysbench](https://github.com/akopytov/sysbench/) is a popular open-source benchmarking tool designed to evaluate the performance of system components such as CPU, memory, disk I/O, and databases. It is commonly used for testing MySQL, PostgreSQL, and other databases under different load conditions.

## Database Benchmarking

`sysbench` supports benchmarking of the [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com), [MariaDB](https://mariadb.org/) and [PostgreSQL](https://postgres.org) open source relational databases. PRs to support other RDBMS products, for example [SQLServer #PR549](https://github.com/akopytov/sysbench/pull/549) also exist.

This documentation focusses on a detailed analysis of the `sysbench` database ecosystem, what`sysbench` tests actually do, and what types of tests are available.

## What is Important with Benchmarking?

The answer will depend on who is asked and what product(s) are being evaluated. Generally the most important measurements for comparison include:

1. Throughput
2. latency
3. Runtime Resource Utilization (e.g. CPU, RAM, I/O, Network)
4. Storage

## The Original 1 Billion Rows

While it's common now to hear about various 1 Billion row benchmarks, we need to recognize one the orginal architects behind this number. Tim Callaghan (yes related to Mark) created the orginal `iibench` (Index Insertion Benchmark) 1 Billion row challenge more than a decade ago.  [1 Billion Insertions â€“ The Wait is Over!](https://www.percona.com/blog/1-billion-insertions-the-wait-is-over/)  published - January 26, 2012.
