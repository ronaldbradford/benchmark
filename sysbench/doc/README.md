# Understanding `sysbench`

[Sysbench](https://github.com/akopytov/sysbench/) is a popular open-source benchmarking tool designed to evaluate the performance of system components such as CPU, memory, disk I/O, and databases. It is commonly used for testing MySQL, PostgreSQL, and other databases under different load conditions.

Created by Alexey Kopytov, `sysbench` has been around for approximately two decades. While `git` shows the first commit as `Jan 2006` this product was previously hosted on [Launchpad](https://launchpad.net/sysbench). The [ChangeLog](https://github.com/akopytov/sysbench/blob/master/ChangeLog) has a first reference of 2004-02-19. The current version is `1.0.20` however there has not been a version release in the past 5 years.

## Database Benchmarking

`sysbench` supports benchmarking of open source databases including [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com), [MariaDB](https://mariadb.org/), [PostgreSQL](https://postgres.org), [RocksDB](https://rocksdb.org/). PRs to support other RDBMS products, for example [SQLServer #PR549](https://github.com/akopytov/sysbench/pull/549) also exist.

This documentation focusses on a detailed analysis of the `sysbench` RDBMS database ecosystem, what`sysbench` tests actually do, and what types of tests are open-source available.

## What is Important with Benchmarking?

The answer will depend on who is asked and what product(s) are being evaluated. Generally the most important measurements for comparison include:

1. Query Throughput
2. Query Latency
3. Runtime Resource Utilization (e.g. CPU, RAM, I/O, Network)
4. Data Storage
5. Total Execution Time

## History of the Original 1 Billion Rows

While it's common now to hear about various 1 Billion row benchmarks, we need to recognize one the original architects behind this number. Tim Callaghan (yes related to Mark) created the original `iibench` (Index Insertion Benchmark) 1 Billion row challenge more than a decade ago. A good summary can be found in [1 Billion Insertions â€“ The Wait is Over!](https://www.percona.com/blog/1-billion-insertions-the-wait-is-over/)  published - January 26, 2012.

Some other 1 Billion Row (1br) examples:
